# MachineQuizzing: Integration of Task-Oriented Chatbots with Generic AI

## Project Description

MachineQuizzing is a task-oriented chatbot designed to help users learn Machine Learning (ML) concepts. The chatbot provides quizzes, checks answers, grades them, explains incorrect answers, gives user statistics and answers any ML-related questions users may have. It integrates Dialogflow for natural language understanding and communication and utilizes Generic AI (Google's Gemini) for generating responses.

## Installation

As MachineQuizzing relies on a Dialogflow agent for natural language processing and understanding, installation and setup are not applicable. However, users can interact with the chatbot through Telegram via [MachineQuizzing Telegram Bot](https://t.me/MachineQuizzingBot). Note that the bot may not be running 24/7. If you'd like to test the bot, please contact the project owner (@yellow_YH) on Telegram.
